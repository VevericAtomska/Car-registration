# Car-registration
As we know, all of us have a long wait in line and we believe that such software in itself would greatly facilitate such a tedious and arduous process. But taking into account the electronic literacy of our people and administrative permits as well as approvals from banks for the implementation of such a project, we understand that there is a lot of room to complicate each step. Too, From a technical point of view, the very complexity of primarily sequence diagrams as well as activity diagrams makes this process much more complex than it actually is. We can also see that if we divide the whole process into smaller units and they are structured, the process itself becomes much easier. As we have already mentioned, if we transfer this project to the real situation we will understand that at every step there can be complications but the diagrams themselves are more than complex to find on them and the range of situations that could befall us is wide and unpredictable. But we firmly believe that each of the current systems where we can see the inconsistency of both regulations and government agencies should be replaced by a software solution that would certainly, although there would be too many complications in the beginning, again we believe that a much better and easier solution would be process. This was our attempt to put such a large system on the screen and try to realize a process that is everyday in the real world.
